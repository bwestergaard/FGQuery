Turn your CBS free agent list into FanGraphs custom leaderboards!

You'll need to update the config.properties file to include your CBS login info, which is not super great, but you can see from the source code
that I'm not doing anything sketchy with it. Unfortunately, exporting your player projections does not include the CBS player IDs.

If you really like this, feel free to throw me a dollar or two at https://ko-fi.com/putsycaballero, but it's really not necessary.
