Turn your CBS free agent list into FanGraphs custom leaderboards!

You'll need to update the config.properties file to include your CBS login info, which is not super great, but you can see from the source code
that I'm not doing anything sketchy with it. Unfortunately, exporting your player projections does not include the CBS player IDs.

You may get some messages like "This player's FanGraphs ID is out of date". This is due to the raw data at smartfantasybaseball.com being out of date,
but it's generally only for fairly obscure players; at time of 1.0 release, the only two pitchers who have pitched this year and have this error are
Conner Greene and Beau Burrows.

If you really like this, feel free to throw me a dollar or two at https://ko-fi.com/putsycaballero, but it's really not necessary.
